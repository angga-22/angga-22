# Hi, you are on the right place! 
Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with 5+ yoe, currently diving deep into security-focused development at the intersection of blockchain and AI technologies.

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m passionate about problem-solving, and Iâ€™m always exploring ways to improve system design and software architecture. Lately, Iâ€™ve been doubling down on building resilient, scalable systems with a strong emphasis on security and decentralization.

ðŸ“š I believe that great engineering starts with great documentationâ€”so much so that I maintain my own personal engineering wiki to keep knowledge organized and accessible.

ðŸš€ Always learning, always building â€” aiming for a master's in computer science and passionate about impactful software development.

ðŸŽ¸ When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me playing guitar or vibing to my favorite playlists. Always up for a good tech discussionâ€”feel free to connect!

## ðŸ“¨ DM me to discuss or talk about projects.
